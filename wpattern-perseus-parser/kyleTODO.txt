Construction
- game_of_life_pomdp domains clearly broken, both in matlab and java
- remove all matlab stuff
- have Policy convert format if conversion not found
- test if ant can build the .jar
- change the ./run script from bin/ to build/
- remove -ea from the run script once development is complete

Testing
- run large instances for memory and time management testing
- write some unit tests for POMDP.java

Competition
- both the java version and the matlab version take REALLY long for the bigger instances of the domains (sysp2, glp2), so we need a method for speeding up the solving process
- figure out how to send action on first turn (talk to Sungwook)
- implement lookahead methods
